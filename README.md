# sophus-rs

This library is in an early development stage - hence API is highly unstable.

Sophus-rs currently requires rust nightly. The only nightly feature it uses is `portable-simd`.
It is the intention to move to rust stable once `portable-simd` is stabilized. There is no current
plan to depend on other nightly features.
