## Lie groups in 2D and 3D: rotations, translations, etc.

Lie groups crate - part of the sophus-rs project

## Integration with sophus-rs

This crate is part of the [sophus umbrella crate](https://crates.io/crates/sophus).
It re-exports the relevant prelude types under [prelude], so you can
seamlessly interoperate with the rest of the sophus-rs types.
